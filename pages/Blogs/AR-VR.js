           <div className='font-mono text-4xl mx-2 my-6'>Introduction</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Definition of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information, such as images, text, and video, onto the real world. It enhances our perception of reality by adding virtual elements to it. Virtual reality (VR), on the other hand, creates a completely immersive digital environment that users can interact with. VR completely replaces the real-world surroundings with a digital simulation.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Brief History of AR and VR</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>The concept of AR and VR can be traced back to the 1960s, with the development of the first head-mounted displays (HMDs). However, it wasn't until the 1990s that the technology began to advance and become more accessible to the public. In 1992, the first VR arcade games were released, and in 1999, the first consumer VR headset, the Sega VR-1, hit the market. Since then, the technology has continued to evolve and improve, with the introduction of smartphones and the development of more advanced AR and VR devices.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Current State of the Technology</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>Today, AR and VR technology is used in a variety of industries, from gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare. Smartphones and tablets have also made it more accessible, with the ability to run AR apps. The use of AR and VR technology in the e-commerce, retail and advertising space is increasing and many companies are experimenting with the technology to create immersive brand experiences. The Gaming industry is the largest adopter of VR technology, making the gaming experience much more immersive and interactive. In recent years, advancements in VR hardware, such as the Oculus Quest and PlayStation VR, have made the technology more accessible to consumers.</div>

           <div className='font-mono text-4xl mx-2 my-6 pt-8'>The Differences between AR and VR</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'> How AR and VR Differ</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>As mentioned earlier, the main difference between AR and VR is the way they interact with the user's perception of reality. AR adds digital information to the real world, while VR creates a completely immersive digital environment. This means that with AR, users can still see and interact with their real-world surroundings, while with VR, they are completely immersed in a digital environment and disconnected from the real world.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Use Cases for AR and VR</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>AR is often used in a variety of industries such as retail, e-commerce, real estate, and architecture, to enhance the user's perception of the product or environment. For example, retailers can use AR to show customers how a piece of furniture would look in their home or how an outfit would look on them before they make a purchase. Architects can use AR to show clients how a building would look once it's completed, before it's built.
VR, on the other hand, is often used in gaming, entertainment, education and training, and healthcare. In gaming, VR creates a more immersive and interactive experience for the player. In education and training, it allows for simulations of real-world scenarios, such as medical procedures, in a safe and controlled environment. In healthcare, it's used for therapy and rehabilitation to treat certain conditions, such as phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Each</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>AR offers a number of advantages over VR, such as being able to see and interact with the real world while still experiencing the digital overlay. It's also less expensive and more accessible, as it can be used with smartphones and tablets.
VR, on the other hand, offers a completely immersive experience and can be more effective in certain scenarios, such as gaming and education.
Both AR and VR have their limitations such as VR can cause motion sickness and disorientation, and the accuracy and quality of the digital overlay in AR is limited by the hardware. It's also important to consider the cost of VR hardware, which can be quite expensive.</div>

           <div className='font-mono text-4xl mx-2 my-6 pt-12'> Applications of AR and VR</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Gaming and Entertainment</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>VR has become a popular application in the gaming industry, providing players with an immersive and interactive gaming experience. Many major gaming companies have developed VR-compatible games and hardware, such as the Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, and the HTC Vive. Some examples of popular VR games include Beat Saber, Superhot VR, and Vader Immortal.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Education and Training</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>VR technology is being increasingly used in education and training, particularly in fields such as medicine, architecture, and engineering. For example, medical students can use VR to practice performing surgeries in a safe and controlled environment, while architects can use VR to visualize and walk through building designs before they are built. VR can also be used for employee training in industries such as manufacturing, allowing employees to practice tasks in a simulated environment before performing them in the real world.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'> Healthcare and Therapy</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>VR is also being used in healthcare for therapy and rehabilitation. For example, it can be used to treat conditions such as phobias, PTSD, and chronic pain. VR can be used to expose patients to virtual environments that mimic the real-world triggers of their condition, allowing them to confront and overcome their fears in a controlled setting.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Retail and E-commerce</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>AR has many applications in the retail and e-commerce space. Many retailers have started using AR apps to let customers try on clothing and accessories or visualizing furniture in their home. AR also allows e-commerce websites to enhance their product listings with interactive and immersive product visualization.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Real Estate and Architecture</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>AR and VR are also being used in real estate and architecture to create virtual tours of properties and building designs. This allows potential buyers and tenants to experience a property as if they were actually there, and it allows architects to get a better sense of how a building will look and function once it's completed.</div>
           <div className='text-3xl mx-2 my-4'>Industrial and Manufacturing</div>
           <div className='text-lg mx-2 my-3'>AR and VR technology can be used in the manufacturing industry to improve efficiency and safety, as well as to enhance the design and testing of products. For example, AR can be used to display information and instructions to workers on the factory floor, while VR can be used to simulate and test manufacturing processes before they are implemented in the real world.</div>
